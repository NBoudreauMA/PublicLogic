        <h1>Founder’s Note</h1>
        <p>
          My name is Nathan Boudreau, and I built <strong>Public_Logic</strong> the only way I know how — from inside town government, under real pressure, with accountability on the line.
        </p>
        <p>
          An ethics uncertainty derailed my career. A cancer scare forced me to stop pretending I could carry everything forever. I’ve lived through the kind of burnout that takes your breath away in the parking lot before you even walk into the building. 
        </p>
        <p>
          But I also know what it means to show up the next day anyway. To patch together a budget at midnight. To fix a turnover by hand because the system didn’t. To smile through a meeting while your whole life feels like it’s unraveling. 
        </p>
        <p>
          That’s why I created <strong>Public_Logic</strong>. Because government staff deserve tools that work. Because compliance shouldn’t be an afterthought. Because the people in municipal buildings — the clerks, the treasurers, the administrators, the DPW crews — deserve infrastructure that makes their work sustainable, not harder. 
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Public_Logic</strong> isn’t about shiny tech. It’s about building rails so the work can move: Town Hall → Compliance → Public Output. It’s about making sure nothing slips, nothing gets lost, and no one is left carrying the weight alone. 
        </p>
